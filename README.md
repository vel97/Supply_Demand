# Interpretation and Insights:
# Supply related insights of factors:
The S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index (CSUSHPISA) shows a very modest positive association with the monthly supply of new homes (MSACSR). 
Because the correlation is so weak, we can conclude it is negative (because supply increase). This implies that an increase in the supply of new homes may have a minor negative 
influence on housing prices.

The number of authorised housing units (PERMIT) has a moderately positive link with home values. This means that a greater number of authorised housing units may contribute to
higher property prices. The reason for this is that when more houses are authorised for building, the supply of houses, materials, and labours is impacted.

Total construction spending on residential projects (TLRESCONS) has a strong positive correlation with home prices. This indicates that higher construction spending is strongly 
associated with higher home prices. The reason for this is simple: construction costs include building materials, labour, and other charges. This raises overall house costs.

# Demand related insights of factors:
The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage (MORTGAGE30US) shows a weak negative correlation with home prices. 
This implies that higher mortgage rates are associated with slightly lower home prices. A rise in the federal funds rate can cause mortgage rates to rise, 
and higher mortgage rates can reduce home buying demand, causing home prices to fall.

Consumer sentiment (UMCSENT) has a weak negative correlation with home prices. Lower consumer sentiment is associated with slightly lower home prices. 
When consumers are confident about the economy, they are more likely to spend money on big-ticket items such as homes which can drive up home prices.

Data show that interest rates or discount rates (INTDSRUSM193N) have a weak positive association with home prices, indicating a scaling or trailing issue. Interest rates are negatively 
correlated with house prices. Higher rates are leads to lower home prices.Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has a strong positive correlation with home prices. 
Higher GDP is strongly associated with higher home prices.

# Conclusion:
Based on the correlation analysis and the coefficients from the Linear Regression model, several key insights can be derived:

Supply factors, such as house inventory and the number of authorized housing units, have a positive influence on home prices. Higher construction spending on residential projects
also contributes significantly to higher home prices.

Demand factor, such as mortgage interest rates, have a negative impact on home prices. Higher mortgage rates and lower consumer sentiment are associated with slightly lower home prices.
Economic factors, including GDP and interest rates, play a crucial role in determining home prices. A strong economy with higher GDP and slightly lower interest rates tends to 
support higher home prices.

The median sales price of houses sold is strongly correlated with home prices, reflecting the importance of market dynamics and buyer behaviour in determining home price movements.
